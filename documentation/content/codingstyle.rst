Overview
--------

This is a document describing the kw preferred coding style. It is important to
highlight that we got inspiration from Linux_ and Git_ code style; for this
reason, we copied and pasted many pieces from both projects.

.. _Git: https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/CodingGuidelines#L41
.. _Linux: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst

.. _shfmt-label:

shfmt
_____

To help us enforce our codestyle decisions we utilize the
`shfmt <https://github.com/mvdan/sh>`_ code formatter in our CI pipeline.
Please refer to the shfmt repository for instructions on how to install it
on your specific linux distribution, it is available as a package for most
distributions and as a plugin for most IDEs and text editors.
To format a file using shfmt::

  shfmt -w -i=2 -ln=bash -fn -ci -sr FILE

To check a file and error with a diff when the formatting differs::

  shfmt -d -i=2 -ln=bash -fn -ci -sr FILE

Indentation
-----------

We adopt two whitespace indentations.

Avoid tricky expression
-----------------------

We try to keep things as simple as possible in kw, for this reason, we try to
**avoid**:

* Multiple assignments on a single line;
* Using more than 10 local variables per function.

.. note::
  Of course, we value the code legibility, for this reason, we accept a few
  exceptions.


Breaking long lines and strings
-------------------------------

The default limit on the length of lines is 80 columns and this is a strongly
preferred limit. This is not a rule to be blindly followed, we understand that
in some cases we need more columns; however, try to do you best for keeping the
code under 80 characters.

Sometimes long strings are a bit cumbersome to keep under 80 columns, in kw we
adopt string concatenation for this case as the example below illustrates::

  my_long_string="kw ran into an unrecoverable error while trying to parse your file."
  my_long_string+=" Do you wish to continue anyway [Y/n]?"

Placing Optional Bash Keywords and Spaces
-----------------------------------------

Some of the bash keywords may accept or not the reserved word ``then`` or
``do`` which can be added at the end of the expression or in the next line. In
kw we put the ``then`` statement at the end of the expression (after the
semicolon), as the example below illustrates::

  if [[ <expression> ]]; then
    do_something
  fi

The same idea applies for loops::

  for <expression>; do
    do_something
  done

or::

  while <expression>; do
    do_something
  done

For the ``case`` statement, we add one level of indentation after the ``case``
statement::

  case <value> in
    option1)
      do_something1
      ;;
    option2)
      do_something2
      ;;
    *)
      exit 22
      ;;
  esac

Functions
---------

.. note::
  Our approach for implementing function is really similar to the ones
  adopted by the Linux Kernel, the description here is an adaptation of the
  Linux Kernel codestyle documentation.

Functions should be short and sweet, and do just one thing. They should fit on
one or two screenfuls of text (the ISO/ANSI screen size is 80x24, as we all
know), and do one thing and do that well.

The maximum length of a function is inversely proportional to the complexity
and indentation level of that function. So, if you have a conceptually simple
function that is just one long (but simple) case-statement, where you have to
do lots of small things for a lot of different cases, it’s OK to have a longer
function.

However, if you have a complex function, and you suspect that a
less-than-gifted first-year high-school student might not even understand what
the function is all about, you should adhere to the maximum limits all the more
closely. Use helper functions with descriptive names.

Another measure of the function is the number of local variables. They
shouldn’t exceed 5-10, or you’re doing something wrong. Re-think the function,
and split it into smaller pieces. A human brain can generally easily keep track
of about 7 different things, anything more and it gets confused. You know
you’re brilliant, but maybe you’d like to understand what you did 2 weeks from
now.

Bash supports function declarations with or without the parentheses and with or
without the reserved word ``function``. In kw source code, we **always** add
the ``function`` reserved word and the parentheses even if the function does
not have any parameter (without an extra space). Additionally, we add the curly
braces in a single line. For example::

  function modules_install_to()
  {
    [..]
  }

For the function returning we try to respect the errno codes, for example::

  function mk_list_installed_kernels
  {
    [..]
      if [ "$?" != 0 ] ; then
        complain "Did you check if your VM is running?"
        return 125 # ECANCELED
      fi
    [..]
  }

As you can notice from the examples, we use snake case for function
definitions, this is valid for all the kw code.

Command substitution and arithmetic expression
----------------------------------------------

We prefer ``$( ... )`` for command substitution; unlike \`\`, it properly nests.

When using command substitution to access the contents of a file the cat
command (``$(cat <file>)``) can be replaced with a ``<`` which is equivalent
but faster (``$(< <file>)``). E.g.: ``$(cat "$file") => $(< "$file")``

For arithmetic expansion we use ``(( ... ))``.

Check for command
-----------------

If you want to find out if a command is available on the user's ``$PATH``, you
should use the function ``command_exists()`` available under kw lib. If you are
working in a plugin or have a strong reason not to use ``command_exists()``,
you should use ``command`` instead of ``which`` since the letter is not machine
parsable and its exit code is not reliable across platforms.

How to include/import files
---------------------------

Do not source code using ``.`` or ``source`` unless you have a very strong
argument. We have a helper function for that named ``include`` in
`kw_include.sh` and it should be used any and every time a file needs to be
sourced, ``. file.sh --source-only`` should only be used to source
`include.sh` itself. The ``include`` function guarantees us that no file will
be sourced twice, making the kw dev life easier with one thing less to worry
about.

Test function name
------------------

Tests are an important part of kw, we only accept new features with tests, and
we prefer bug fixes that come with tests. For trying to keep the test
comprehensible, we adopt the following pattern for naming a test::

    test_target_function_name_[_<description>]()

To better illustrate this definition, see the example below::

    function test_detect_distro()

This function name indicates that we are testing ``detect_distro`` function.
Another example::

    function test_save_config_file_check_description()

The function ``save_config_file`` is tested with a focus on description
validation.

Resources for tests
-------------------

We encourage the use of the following features offered by shunit2, kworkflow's
unit test framework.

 - Functions ``oneTimeSetUp`` and ``oneTimeTearDown``: If defined, these functions
   will be called once before and after any tests are run, respectively. Notice
   that shunit2 is sourced once for each test file, so the scope of
   these functions is effectively the test file (e.g. `help_test.sh`) in
   which they are defined.
 - Functions ``setUp`` and ``tearDown``: If defined, these functions will be
   called before and after each test (i.e. a test function) is run, respectively.
 - Shunit2 offers a temporary directory that will be cleaned upon it's exit. The
   path to this directory is stored in the variable ``SHUNIT_TMPDIR``. Note
   however that this directory is not cleaned up between tests, so you may
   need to clear it in the ``tearDown`` function.

We also encourage each assertion in each test to be identified with the
variable ``LINENO``. This variable expands to the line number currently being
executed. This way the origin of an error message can quickly be identified by
a developer. We also encourage using the ``assert_equals_helper`` helper
function, which provides a wrapper capable of spitting a useful error message
in case the assertion fails. Ideally, one should do either::

   assert_equals_helper "$error_message" "($LINENO)" "$output" "$expected_output"

or::

   assertEquals "($LINENO)" "$output" "$expected_output"

Help functions
--------------

Each subcommand may have its help function that details its usage. This
function should be located as close as possible to the feature they document;
ideally, we want it in the same file. For example, you should find details on
using the ``build`` option in the ``build.sh``, and for
``kernel-config-manager`` in the file `kernel_config_manager.sh`.

Handling Signals
----------------

It is natural for commands to set global variables or to create temporary files
during their execution. However, all commands should expect to receive signals
and be able to properly handle them. If you implement a new feature, take some
time to check if it pollutes the environment. If it does, make sure to handle
it's de-pollution upon receiving a SIGINT or a SIGTERM: an interrupted command
should always leave the environment in the same state as it was prior to its
invocation. Convenience functions for this purpose (setting and resetting
handlers for arbitrary signals) are implemented in `src/signal_manager`.

Use ``printf`` instead of ``echo``
----------------------------------

We stay away from ``echo`` as it is not always consistent with its output
depending on system and bash version. Therefore always use ``printf`` instead,
it stays consistent across multiple platforms. If you need to add extra lines
while generating a string you can use the ``$'\n'`` literal to add a new line
character or other special characters.

String concatenation
--------------------

If you have any type of string concatenation, always use ``${<string>}``. For
example::

  kernel_path="${PWD}/"
  kw_path="${HOME}/.local/.config"

How to handle return
--------------------

When handling return value and its manipulation inside kw, use the errno code
pattern. By adopting this pattern, we standardize the expected errors and
provide meaningful error codes for the user. Finally, always add a comment next
to the return value with the string reference to it, for example::

  return 22 # EINVAL
  return 2 # ENOENT

Avoid short options
-------------------

Usually, commands available in the terminal provide two ways of passing the
same option: through a short option and through a long option. The short
options are convenient for daily use; however, for writing kw code it is better
to use the long option because it is more human readable. See the below
example:

Bad::

  rsync -vr dir1 dir2

Good::

  rsync --verbose --recursive dir1 dir2

Conclusion
----------

When in doubt of a coding style matter not specified in this file, it is always
a good idea to search how other sections of the codebase use the term you are
in doubt about. But be aware that some sections may unfortunately be at odds
with the specified style rules (and pull requests to correct them are very
welcome). Finally, feel free to also suggest modifications to this document --
to add absent rules -- or mention any style doubts in your pull request.
