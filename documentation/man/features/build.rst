SYNOPSIS
========
| *kw* (*b* | *build*) [(-i | \--info)] [\--alert=(s | v | (sv | vs) | n)]
| *kw* (*b* | *build*) [(-n | \--menu)] [\--alert=(s | v | (sv | vs) | n)]
| *kw* (*b* | *build*) [(-d | \--doc)] [\--alert=(s | v | (sv | vs) | n)]
| *kw* (*b* | *build*) [(-c | \--cpu-scaling)] <percentage> [\--alert=(s | v | (sv | vs) | n)]
| *kw* (*b* | *build*) [\--ccache] [\--alert=(s | v | (sv | vs) | n)]

DESCRIPTION
===========
If users invoke this option without parameters, *kw* will look at the local
Makefile and, based on that, start to build the project. This option tries to
take advantage of your hardware by using the ``-j`` option with the appropriate
parameter.

This command can be used in conjunction with :ref:`deploy<deploy-doc>` by
invoking ``kw bd``.

.. note::
  This command must be run inside of a kernel tree.

OPTIONS
=======
-i, \--info:
  The info option, makes so the build information such as the kernel release
  name and the total number of modules compiled will be displayed.

-n, \--menu:
  The menu option invokes the kernel menuconfig. Notice that the default menu
  config can be changed in the **kworkflow.config** file by setting a different
  option in *menu_config*. If the user is working in a *cross-compile*
  environment, it is recommended to use this option to avoid messing with the
  config file manually.

-d, \--doc:
  The doc option provides a mechanism for building the kernel-doc; by default,
  it will build htmldocs. Users can change the default documentation output by
  changing the parameter *doc_type* in the **kworkflow.config** file.

-c, \--cpu-scaling:
  The cpu-scaling option lets the user set whichever usage they want from their
  CPU, basically setting the ``-j`` flag accordingly.

\--ccache:
  This option allows the user to enable ``ccache`` usage during compilation
  tasks, which should improve compile times in subsequent compilations. 

\--alert=(s | v | (sv | vs) | n):
  Defines the alert behaviour upon the command completion.
    | **s** enables sound notification.
    | **v** enables visual notification.
    | **sv** or **vs** enables both.
    | **n** (or any other option) disables notifications (this is the default).

EXAMPLES
========
For these examples, we suppose the fields in your **kworkflow.config** file are
already configured.

For building and installing a new module version based on the current kernel
version, you can use::

  cd <kernel-path>
  kw bd
