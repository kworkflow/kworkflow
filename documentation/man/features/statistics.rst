DESCRIPTION
===========
**kw** keeps track of metadata regarding utilization of features. This data is
used to show **kw** usage statistics. In summary, **kw** keeps track of:

1. **Build**

2. **Deploy** (included list and uninstall)

For all the data tracked by **kw**, users can retrieve the total amount of time
spent by a specific command, the average time consumed by the feature and the
shortest and highest time required for executing the feature. All of this
information can be retrieved by the **statistics** command, the options define
the levels of granularity.

OPTIONS
=======
\--day [<year>/<month>/<day>]:

  date by passing an argument that follows the *<year>/<month>/<day>* format.

\--week [<year>/<month>/<day>]:
  Shows the week summary. If a user does not pass any parameter kw will show
  the current week statistics. However, users can pass a random date
  *<year>/<month>/<day>* and let **kw** take care to provide a summary
  related to the week related to the target date.

\--month [<year>/<month>]:
  Shis option shows a report regarding a specific month. Users can search for
