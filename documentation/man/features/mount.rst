SYNOPSIS
========
*kw* (*mo* | *mount*) [\--alert=(s | v | (sv | vs) | n)]

DESCRIPTION
===========
Projects that use a QEMU VM in the development cycle to host the development
environment usually require that developers use some specific commands to
manage the access to the VM files. For this reason, we have commands like
**mount**, :ref:`umount<umount-doc>` and :ref:`up<up-doc>`.

This mounts the QEMU image in a specific directory, based on the data available
in the **kworkflow.config** file. Notice that the configuration file has the
information about the source image and destination mount point.

.. note::
  **Only run this command after you turn off your VM**.

OPTIONS
=======
\--alert=(s | v | (sv | vs) | n):
  Defines the alert behaviour upon the command completion.
    | **s** enables sound notification.
    | **v** enables visual notification.
    | **sv** or **vs** enables both.
    | **n** (or any other option) disables notifications (this is the default).
