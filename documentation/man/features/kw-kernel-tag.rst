DESCRIPTION
===========
This feature adds Linux kernel tags to either commits or patches and helps
to make this kind of task quicker to complete. It's a wrapper to some useful
usage of the ``git commit --amend``, ``git rebase`` and ``git interpret-trailers``
commands. By default, it uses the commit currently pointed by `HEAD`
as the target of the operation if user does not specify one. At least one **--add**
option is required.

Most kernel tags contain a tag like:

.. code-block:: text

  TAG: NAME <EMAIL>

By default, options that add these types of tags will use your current `user.name`
and `user.email` from git configuration if nothing is specified in the command line.

Using multiple options combined is possible. For instance, the following
command will add **Tested-by** and **Signed-off-by**, in this order,
to the commit's trailers pointed by `HEAD` using `user.name` and
`user.email` from git config::

  $ kw kernel-tag -t -s

The order the trailer lines are added follows the general sequence:

.. code-block:: text

   Signed-off-by
   Tested-by
   Reported-by
   Co-developed-by
   Acked-by
   Reviewed-by
   Fixes

At the same time, new lines are grouped by their tags. For example:

.. code-block:: text

   $ kw kernel-tag -s'Joe Doe <joe@mail.xyz>' -s -t -t'Joe Doe <joe@mail.xyz>'

   Tested-by: Some Name <some@mail.xyz>
   Signed-off-by: Some Name <some@mail.xyz>
   Tested-by: Joe Doe <joe@mail.xyz>
   Signed-off-by: Joe Doe <joe@mail.xyz>

However, it's important to note that every new tag is added **after** the old ones
that were already present in the commit or patch message.

Another important aspect of this command is that, since it uses ``git rebase``
as a part of its backend, if we run it using a SHA like ``kw tag -s HEAD~3``
then only commits refered by ``HEAD~2``, ``HEAD~1`` and ``HEAD`` will be affected.
This has the same behavior when you execute ``git rebase --interactive HEAD~3``.

OPTIONS
=======
-s, \--add-signed-off-by:
  Adds a **Signed-off-by** kernel tag line to either commits or patchsets.
  By default it uses `user.name` and `user.email` from git config to
  write these lines if no argument is given to this option.

-r, \--add-reviewed-by:
  Adds a **Reviewed-by** kernel tag line to either commits or patchsets.
  By default it uses `user.name` and `user.email` from git config to
  write these lines if no argument is given to this option.

-a, \--add-acked-by:
  Adds a **Acked-by** kernel tag line to either commits or patchsets.
  By default it uses `user.name` and `user.email` from git config to
  write these lines if no argument is given to this option.

-t, \--add-tested-by:
  Adds a **Tested-by** kernel tag line to either commits or patchsets.
  By default it uses `user.name` and `user.email` from git config to
  write these lines if no argument is given to this option.

-C, \--add-co-developed-by:
  Adds a **Co-developed-by** immediately followed by a **Signed-off-by**
  kernel tag line to either commits or patchsets. By default it uses
  `user.name` and `user.email` from git config to write these lines if
  no argument is given to this option.

-R, \--add-reported-by:
  Adds a **Reported-by** kernel tag line to either commits or patchsets.
  By default it uses `user.name` and `user.email` from git config to
  write these lines if no argument is given to this option. Also, the
  user has the option to pass a **Closes** or **Link** as an additional
  tag that will be added immediately after for cases when the bug report
  is available in the web.

-f, \--add-fixes:
  Adds a **Fixes** kernel tag line to either commits or patchsets.
  It requires an argument, which must be a valid commit reference, to
  define the fixed commit's hash that follows this tag.

\--verbose:
  Displays commands executed under the hood.

EXAMPLES
========
Adding a **Reviewed-by** line to commit pointed by ``HEAD``::

  $ kw kernel-tag --add-reviewed-by='Reviewer Name <reviewer@mail.org>'

Adding an **Acked-by** line starting from ``HEAD~2`` until ``HEAD``::

  $ kw kernel-tag --add-acked-by='Some Name <example@mail.com>' HEAD~3

Adding **Fixes** line to commit pointed by ``HEAD``, which fixes another
previous commit ``90a7ba23340d``::

  $ kw kernel-tag --add-fixes='90a7ba23340d'

All the above options can be used to perform operations over `.patch` files as well::

  $ kw kernel-tag -r'Reviewer Name <reviewer@mail.org>' example.patch

  $ kw kernel-tag -a'Some Name <example@mail.org>' example.patch

  $ kw kernel-tag -f'90a7ba23340d' example.patch

This command accepts multiples arguments, which means that multiple files
(both names and globs) and commits can be passed with one single command.

Adding **Signed-off-by** line to multiple `.patch` files::

  $ kw kernel-tag -s'Some Name <example@mail.org>' file1.patch file2.patch

This command also accepts globs to reference multiple `.patch` files::

  $ kw kernel-tag -s'Some Name <example@mail.org>' *.patch

One more complex example than the one seen in **DESCRIPTION** is::

  $ kw kernel-tag -s'Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.xyz>' \
    -t'Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.xyz>' \
    -R'Michael Doe <michaeldoe@mail.xyz>;Closes=https://link-to-bug.xyz' \
    -C'John Doe <johndoe@mail.xyz>' \
    -C'Michael Doe <michaeldoe@mail.xyz>' \
    -r'Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.xyz>'

That will write these trailers like so:

.. code-block:: text
  
  Reported-by: Michael Doe <michaeldoe@mail.xyz>
  Closes: https://link-to-bug.xyz
  Co-developed-by: Michael Doe <michaeldoe@mail.xyz>
  Signed-off-by: Michael Doe <michaeldoe@mail.xyz>
  Co-developed-by: John Doe <johndoe@mail.xyz>
  Signed-off-by: John Doe <johndoe@mail.xyz>
  Tested-by: Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.xyz>
  Reviewed-by: Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.xyz>
  Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.xyz>
