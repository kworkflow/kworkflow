[text_interactive_start]:
Welcome to the interactive mode! We will ask you a series of questions regarding
how do you want to configure kernel workflow. Before each question there will be
a brief explanation of the feature and why it is used. This is not exhaustive,
we recommend you search for more information online. Please follow the prompts
to continue.


[text_ssh_start]:
We will now setup SSH. SSH stands for Secure Shell and is a networking protocol
used for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. This is
useful if you want to deploy a kernel remotely or inside a virtual machine (VM).
Deploying in a remote machine or VM is recommended so you do not break your own
kernel. For a tutorial on how to setup a VM compatible with KW refer to:
https://flusp.ime.usp.br/others/use-qemu-to-play-with-linux/ KW will now attempt
to automatically locate SSH. If your Linux distribution is not Debian or Arch
this will likely fail. We do not support any other distributions (yet). We
strongly recommend using one of these distributions to work with KW.


[text_ssh_lookup]:
SSH requires a RSA key to establish secure connections.
We will now verify if your system has a RSA key available.
We can create a local key or a global key.
Local keys will be stored in kw's directory.
Global keys will be stored in $HOME/.ssh/
Global keys will be visible to other programs.


[text_ssh_keys]:
We found some ssh keys. We will list them
and if you wish you can select one of them
for kw's use by pressing the associated number
followed by ENTER.


[text_remote_start]:
Please input your remote user and ip.
If you press enter without typing anything, we will
use the default values: root for user and localhost for ip.
