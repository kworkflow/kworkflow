# About

kw has a simple mission: reduce the setup overhead of working with the Linux
kernel and provide tools to support developers in their daily tasks. If you
have a set of repeatable tasks that you usually perform while working in your
favorite kernel subsystem or similar, consider adding it as a part of kw.

# Install

Take a look at
[Install and Uninstall](documentation/content/installanduninstall.rst).

# How to

If you want to know more about kw's usage and its commands, take a look at
[Kw man](documentation/man/kw.rst) or, with kw installed, run `kw man`.

# Tests

If you want to know more about kw's tests take a look at
[kw tests](documentation/content/tests.rst).

# Generate Sphinx Documentation

If you want to generate the Sphinx documentation, you can use:

```
./setup.sh --docs
```

Finally, you can use your browser to look at the **index.html** page. For
example:

```
firefox build/index.html
```
