[welcome_page]:
This is the kw guided setup to help you through the first-time configuration. Please, read each page carefully to ensure you have the best configuration for your needs.

[configure_compiler]:
By default, kw configures GCC as the default compiler; however, you can change to LLVM.

[menu_option]:
The kernel offers several user interfacing tools with which you can manually configure the kernel options. Kw allows you to configure the menu configuration you feel more comfortable with.
If the above description does not mean anything to you, we recommend you keep the default option.

[cross_compile]:
A cross compiler is a compiler capable of creating executable code for a platform other than the one on which the compiler is running.

[reboot_after_deploy]:
If you want to reboot your target machine after the deploy gets done, you can change the option `reboot_after_deploy` from "no" to "yes".
