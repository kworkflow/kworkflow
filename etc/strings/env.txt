[use_failure_explanation]:
If you are trying to use kw env, you must ensure that your kernel tree is
clean; in other words, it should not have any file that results from a
compilation, and it should not have the .config file.

If you have already created the env, you can safely run kw build --full-cleanup
and run kw env --use <ENV_NAME>.
