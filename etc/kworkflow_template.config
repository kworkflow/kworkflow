# Use this parameter to configure how kw will handle the dtb files. Follows
# some examples on how to use this parameter:
# Empty (dtb_copy_pattern=): It will use the battern *.dtb in the dts folder
# Pattern path (e.g., dtb_copy_pattern=broadcom/*): It will copy all dtb files
#  inside broadcom folder.
# Copy folder (dtb_copy_pattern=broadcom): Points to a folder.
# Multiple folder copy (dtb_copy_pattern=broadcom,rockchip,arm): You can
# specify multiple folder to be deployed.
